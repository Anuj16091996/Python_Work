This is your assignment. You need to do it as a group. And you will upload ONE SINGLE FILE PER GROUP.
 A password is  considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met).
Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.
In one step, you can:
Insert one character to password,
Delete one character from password, or
Replace one character of password with another character.
 
Example 1:
Input: password = "a"
Output: 5
Example 2:
Input: password = "aA1"
Output: 3
Example 3:
Input: password = "1337C0d3"
Output: 0

A palindrome is a number, a word, or a sentence that remains identical whether read from left to right or from right to left. For example, each of the following five-digit numbers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554, 11611. Write a program capable of reading a positive integer (greater than 0) with five digits, and of determining whether this integer is a palindrome.
