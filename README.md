Assigment23.py-A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].


Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
 
Constraints:
1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 1000
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.



Assigment29.py-You are given an integer array nums.
You should move each element of nums into one of the two arrays A and B such that A and B are non-empty, and average(A) == average(B).
Return true if it is possible to achieve that and false otherwise.
Note that for an array arr, average(arr) is the sum of all the elements of arr over the length of arr.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: true
Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have an average of 4.5.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: false
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 30
0 <= nums[i] <= 104




Py10Work
This is your assignment. You need to do it as a group. And you will upload ONE SINGLE FILE PER GROUP.
 A password is  considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met).
Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.
In one step, you can:
Insert one character to password,
Delete one character from password, or
Replace one character of password with another character.
 
Example 1:
Input: password = "a"
Output: 5
Example 2:
Input: password = "aA1"
Output: 3
Example 3:
Input: password = "1337C0d3"
Output: 0
